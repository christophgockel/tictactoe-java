# Java Tic Tac Toe

Uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) as its build tool.

You can build it with the `jar` target.  
For playing the game, there's a `play` target.

The [Gradle Wrapper](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is packaged in this repository.

To build and run the game you execute the following commands from the project root:

```
$: ./gradlew clean jar
$: ./gradlew play
```
